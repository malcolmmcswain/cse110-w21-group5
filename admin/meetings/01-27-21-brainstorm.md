# Team #5 Meeting
### Attendance and Time
Absent: none

Held on zoom at 8:00PM PST

END: 9:07 PM

## History:
Mr. Cirilo created the technique inspired by a kitchen pomodoro (tomato in Italian)
shaped timer.

Purpose: To eliminate distractions from surroundings and avoid burning out.

25 wax on, 5 min wax off
- If 4 pomo repeated rest is 30 min

If “disturbed” during work -> inform, negotiate, and call back strategy

**Note: use a pie to indicate time (as opposed to digits) in spirit of the OG timer and also less
distracting imo** 

## QUESTIONS
- Is it project to project based? Or per use based?
- Can you pause while being in the middle of a pomodoro cycle?
- If there was a pause in the pomodoro, how does that affect counting toward the long
break?
- Decide how many pomodoros when you start or as needed basis?
## Features
Customizable time -> but not noticeable upon use, set it and done; have to go to settings

Can add a pomodoro for a task right after the pomodoro.

Project based or task based so upon creation of task, set how many pomodoro when created.

## Next Time
- Meeting @ Saturday 8:00 PM PST
- Go over ideas, start brainstorming and designing wireframe/ framework
- Formalize rest of the team member's roles
