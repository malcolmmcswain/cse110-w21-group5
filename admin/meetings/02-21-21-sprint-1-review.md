### Attendance and Time

## Workload
- Workload is mostly reasonable
- Review Quizzes/ labs can be a bit stressful
- Manageable

# Next steps
- Focus on having the distraction log, back end is close to complete
- Manage local storage
- More descriptive buttons
- Some type of way (info button) to inform the user what and how to use the pomo

## Counter cycle
- Do we want to reset the pomo completely?
- Counter is keeping track of the total cycles
- Once we add in the project lists, want to be able to keep track of how many pomos completed in total
- Maybe add a pomo count reset in options
- integrate total pomos completed in the task list
- When you click reset, should go onto the next pomo count?
- Don't include the breaks in the pomo session
- Change reset button to abandon session
- Onboarding

## Start thinking about accessibility
- Sound effects
- **keyboard shortcuts**
- voice commands
